## App Name: LingoDeck

### Brief Description
Lingodeck is a native Android app designed to make language learning efficient and permanent.
Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it uses a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) algorithm to schedule flashcard reviews at the optimal moment, just before a user is likely to forget a word.
This way users can maximize their retention while not wasting study time.

## App Concept

### Use Case
Efficient Vocabulary Acquisition: The primary use case is daily vocabulary study for language learners.
Instead of reviewing static lists or paper flashcards (which leads to over-studying known words and under-studying difficult ones), the user opens Lingodeck once a day.
The app automatically presents only the specific cards that are "due" based on the user's past performance, handling the complex scheduling logic in the background.

---

### Target User
The target users are:
- Students learning a foreign language  
- Self-learners preparing for exams or travel  
- Busy learners who want to maximise learning results in minimal time
*Anyone learning a new language who wants to optimize their vocab studying.

Users typically use the app on their Android smartphone in short, frequent sessions.

---

### Goal of the App
The goal of LingoDeck is to make language learning easier and more effective by reducing unnecessary repetition and focusing on long-term memory retention.

---

### The Problem
Traditional memorisation of vocabulary lists rarely leads to long-term retention. Learners often spend a lot of time reviewing words they already know while forgetting difficult ones.

---

### The Solution
LingoDeck provides a modern Android-based flashcard application that uses a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to optimise learning sessions.

---

### Core Mechanism: Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

#### How It Works
- The app tracks the user’s performance on every individual flashcard  
- Based on correct or incorrect answers, an algorithm calculates optimal review intervals  
- Easy cards are shown less frequently, while difficult cards are reviewed more often  

This ensures that users spend less time studying while remembering more.

---

### Expected Outcome
Users study more efficiently, reduce unnecessary repetition, and achieve better long-term vocabulary retention with less overall effort.

## Hi-Fi Prototype & User Flow

### Main User Flow
The user flow, demonstrates how a user navigates from opening the app to completing a study session.

####Screen Breakdown:

Deck List (Home): The entry point where users manage different languages (e.g., German, Spanish).
Deck Detail (Dashboard): A view showing the "Upcoming Reviews" bar chart and a list of all cards. This allows the user to see their workload for the week.
Study Mode (The Core Loop): The clean interface where cards are presented. Users interact via gestures (swiping) to grade their memory retention, which immediately updates the database schedule.
